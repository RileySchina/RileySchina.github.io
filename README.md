This site is made for two purposes:
    - As a portfolio site to show off past and future projects that I have been involved with
    - As a place to show visualizations that are being made for IAT 355 projects and assignments

This site mainly uses HTML and CSS, with JavaScript to help render and animate visualizations

The main navigation of the site is at the top with tags for both a home page and a visualizations page. The home page has a brief introduction about myself and my interests, a section detailing my education and skills, a section listing different projects, a section with a slideshow showing different projects (made using JavaScript), and a brief contact section.

The visualizations page contains the various visualizations that I will be making for the IAT 355 class. The first visualization is a pie chart that was generated using JavaScript to insert it into the page. The javascript for the pie chart contains the data that then runs some calculations to get the dimensions for the different segments of the pie chart. The measurements are then drawn using arcs and inserted into the html. The second, is a smiley face than on hover (using JavaScript) expands to 4 times its size; this was put in as a bit of a joke. The JavaScript uses an event listener for mousehover and mouseexit to determine when to expand the smiley face and when to reset it to its original size.
